# JCA: if for some reason the server works properly when starting with

# When the pool initialization is completed (above), there should be no
# busy threads in the main process (psycopg2 threads can probably be ignored
# since they have no reason to be running if the server is doing nothing).
#
# If there are, uwsgi may fork the "wrong" one at the wrong time, and become
# unresponsive. Typical cause (what led me here the first time) would be a
# cache invalidation triggered in the side MemoryCache listeners. There should
# be NO CACHE INVALIDATION when the pool is initialized.
#
# If this is not the cause, good luck
